The tour guide will always enter the museum before his first visitor, and leave after his last visitor (either his 10th visitor or when the visitor leaving means there's no more visitors inside).

A visitor will enter if and only if there's 1 or more "spots" available in the museum. Since each guide adds 10 spots, no extra visitors can enter (11 visitors, 1 guide will never finish)

The only problem is that for some reason, sometimes it seems like the first few test arrival messages get "cut off" when the autograder runs. It only happens very rarely, but it seems to just completely skip a few lines, causing me to fail the test. This never happens running on qemu. I'm not sure why this is the case because if you go through my code there is no way for it to enter the museum without first running the arrival print statement.
It seems to be a race condition I just cannot find, but the ONLY effect is that it doesn't print the arrival statement (it still enters and leaves the museum just fine)
