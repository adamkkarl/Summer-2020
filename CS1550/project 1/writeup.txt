FIFO Queue vs Priority Queue in a Semaphore

While using a priority queue has the benefit of allowing high priority processes to
"skip the line" and jump ahead of high priority processes, one main benefit of using a
FIFO queue is that it eliminates the possibility of starvation. It's possible that
with a long queue of waiting processes, one or more low priority processes in a prio queue
will end up waiting indefinitely (starving) as they keep getting jumped in line faster than
processes leave the queue. The downside of a FIFO queue is that no matter how important
a process is, it will always enter the queue in the back of the line. Once instance where
this could be detrimental is if a high priority writing process ends up waiting on
several reading processes. It would make a lot more sense to write first so that the
reading processes have the most up to date information, but such an implementation
is much more practical with a priority queue.
